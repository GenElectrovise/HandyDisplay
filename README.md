# What a Handy Display!

This is the software section of an electronics project I've wanted to try for several years (as of this writing in 2023).

The Handy Display is a TFT LCD display which I am driving from my ancient Raspberry Pi 2B+ which I haven't so far gotten
much use out of. The Handy Display is written in Python and displays all kinds of helpful information about my calendar,
the weather and anything else I'll care to add a widget for.
